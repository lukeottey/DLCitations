# DLCitations
An unnecessary amount of deep learning & computer vision & mathematics research papers organized by category. Running 'main.py' auto-generates a .tex file by parsing through user-input .bib files and a .json file indicating the .tex file's table of contents.
(CATEGORIZING THE PAPER NAMES INTO THE TABLE OF CONTENTS TAKES A LONG TIME AND IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS -- UNCATEGORIZED PAPERS ARE UNDER THE 'no-category' SECTION)
